# Creating a Connection

This guide explains how to create a new connection using the Morph Cloud SDK. A connection represents a link between your application and a third-party service (like HubSpot or Salesforce) for a specific user or organization.

## Installation

First, install the required packages:

```bash
yarn add @runmorph/cloud
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of creating a connection:

```typescript
import { Morph } from "@runmorph/cloud";

// Initialize Morph instance
const morph = Morph({
  apiKey: process.env.MORPH_API_KEY,
  apiSecret: process.env.MORPH_API_SECRET,
});

// Create a connection
const { data, error } = await morph
  .connection({
    connectorId: "hubspot",
    ownerId: "my_customer_id",
  })
  .create({ operations: ["genericContact::list", "crmOpportunity::create"] });
```
